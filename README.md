# Dotfiles
So, this is my first legit repo and I would like to give this honor to my dotfiles, as I finally determined to start learning coding for sure. Basically it's based on [Nick Nisi's amazing dotfiles](https://github.com/nicknisi/dotfiles). Cheers!

## Fonts
I use [Menlo for Powerline](https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline).

## nvim
There is no good reason of me using neovim, I am not that experienced, but I still replaced vim. My dotfiles only considers nvim and does not touch vim's configuration, and is an adoption of Nick's config with slight modification to match my own taste.
(not quite using it right now)

## zsh
Again, there is no good reason of me using zsh. It's based on oh-my-zsh. The original one is too much for me, so I just picked what I need. 

## ~~tmux~~
(not using it anymore)

## Intellij
Just started using it, had a custom OneDark theme.
